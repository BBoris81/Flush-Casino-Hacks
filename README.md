## PNG
Portable Network Graphics (PNGs) were developed to deliver lossless compression of media files offering higher resolution and thus quality and better color displays. Moreover, PNGs are known for their compatibility with transparent images. That is why corporate logos are often in PNG format.

## JPEG
Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEGs or JPGs) is an old specification released in 1992. It is by far the most popular image format. JPEGs are known for lossy compression resulting in poorer quality images compared to PNGs. However, it was designed taking into account the nature of human eyes thus for basic usage the results are satisfactory. They are selected for their limited size.

## SVG
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) use XML-based text to shape the designs and colors of an image. This makes SVGs ideal for web graphics including logos and icons. While SVGs are designer favorites they can be easily used by professional and amateur users of the web. Key characteristics is that SVG files retain their high quality at any size with relatively small file size but they aren't compatible with older web browsers.
